# 1. Variables and Strings
# Example: Personalized Greeting for Your Pet Robot!

robot_name = "RoboMax"   # Give your robot a cool name

greeting = "Hello, my name is " + robot_name + ". I am here to take over the world!"

print(greeting)



# A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
#
#  o  A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
#  o  A variable name cannot start with a number
#  o  A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
#  o  Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
#  o  A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.



# Legal variable names:

myvar = "SLHS"
my_var = "SLHS"
_my_var = "SLHS"
myVar = "SLHS"
MYVAR = "SLHS"
myvar2 = "SLHS" 


# Illegal variable names:

2myvar = "SLHS"
my-var = "SLHS"
my var = "SLHS"
