# Exercise 4: January Savings Tracker
# Step 1: Create a variable to represent your total savings in January. Initialize it to 0.
# Use a loop to simulate saving a random amount (between 5 and 50) each day for 31 days.
# After each day's savings, print the total so far.
#
# Step 2: Add a condition to check if the total savings exceed 1000.
# If so, print a message saying "Goal reached!" and stop the loop early.
# If the loop finishes without exceeding 1000, print "Keep saving!"
