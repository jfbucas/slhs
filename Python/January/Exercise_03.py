# Exercise 3: January Book Tracker
# Step 1: Create a list of five books you want to read in January.
# Use a loop to print each book with its position in the list (1, 2, 3, ...).
#
# Step 2: Add a condition to check if the book title contains the letter 'J' (case insensitive).
# If it does, print "This book fits the January theme!"
